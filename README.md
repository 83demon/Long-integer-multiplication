# Long-integer-multiplication
What is it able to do? You can multiply big numbers really fast, that even doesn't fit into long long int type. Here, numbers are treated as string representation.<br/>
Also, you can check big numbers for simplicity in a decent time.<br/>
Implemented methods of fast multiplications: Karatsuba.<br/>
Implemented simplicity tests: Fermat, Miller-Rabin, Solovay-Strassen. <br/>
Toom-Cook fast multiplication method is unstable, I would recommend to use Karatsuba.<br/>
Output for simpilcity tests: 1 - number is simple, 0 - number is compound.
