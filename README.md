# Long-integer-multiplication
What is it able to do? You can multiply big numbers really fast, that even doesn't fit into long long int type. Also, you can check big numbers for simplicity in a decent time.<br />
Implemented methods of fast multiplications: Karatsuba. Implemented simplicity tests: Fermat, Miller-Rabin, Solovay-Strassen. Toom-Cook fast multiplication method is unstable, I would recommend to use Karatsuba.
Output for simpilcity tests: 1 - number is simple, 0 - number is compound.
